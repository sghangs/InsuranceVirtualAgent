The first thing **you** must do:

#### *We recommend that you check the cover provided on your schedule*

**You** should:

- If **you** are the victim of theft, riot, malicious damage, or property is lost or stolen away from **your home**, urgently inform the Police and obtain a crime or lost property reference number. In the case of riot **you** need to inform the Police within 14 days of the event.
- Contact **us** as soon as possible and tell **us** about the incident. Important contact details are shown in **your** 'AXA Account'.
- Take all reasonable steps to recover missing property.
- Take all reasonable steps to prevent further damage to **your** property.

### **Making a claim**

If **you** need to make a claim **you** can either:

- **1.** Report **your** claim online. This will:
	- save the cost of the phone call from **your** mobile or landline, and
	- avoid wasting time waiting in queues.
- **2.** Or call **0330 024 8086** *(Calls are recorded and monitored)*

What **you** should do in an emergency

- Take any necessary steps to prevent further damage to the property such as switching off the gas electricity and water supply.
- **You** must not dispose of any damaged items or conduct permanent repairs because **we** may need to inspect the damage.

**Our** promise

- **You** will speak to a knowledgeable and trained member of staff who can discuss the claim and explain the next steps.
- **We** will call **you** back when promised.
- **We** will provide **you** with regular updates on **your** claim.

#### **What you must do after making your claim**

- To help prove **your** claim **we** may require **you** to provide original purchase receipts, invoices, bank or credit card statements, instruction booklets, photographs, utility bills, pre-purchase surveys or plans and deeds of **your** property;
- To help assist in dealing with **your** claim **we** may require **you** to obtain estimates for the replacement or repair of damaged property;
- **We** will only ask for information relevant to **your** claim and **we** will pay for any reasonable expenses **you** incur in providing **us** with the above information as part of **your** claim;
- If someone is holding **you** or **your family** responsible for damage to their property or bodily injury to them **you** must provide **us** with full details as soon as possible. **You** must also send **us** any claim form, application notice, legal document or other correspondence sent to **you** or **your family** as soon as possible.
- **You** must assist **us** with any enquiries **we** have regarding **your** claim as it will enable **us** to deal with it quickly.
- **You** must allow **us** access to the **buildings** that have been damaged to salvage anything **we** can and ensure no more damage occurs. However, **you** must not abandon **your** property to **us**.

#### **What you must not do:**

- If someone is holding **you** or **your family** responsible for injury or any damage, neither **you** nor **your family** must admit responsibility or make / reach any agreement with them.
- Abandon any property for **us** to deal with.
- Dispose of damaged items as **we** may need to see them.

**We** are entitled, if **we** choose and in **your** name, but at **our** expense, to:

- take over any rights in the defence or **settlement** of any claim;
- take legal action in **your** name to get compensation or recover any **money** due from a third party in **your** name.

**We** are entitled to take possession of the property insured and deal with any salvage.

#### **How we settle claims**

- **We** may repair, reinstate or replace the lost or damaged property. If **we** cannot replace or repair the property **we** may pay for the loss or damage in cash. Where **we** can offer repair or replacement through a preferred supplier, but **we** agree to pay a cash settlement, then payment will not exceed the amount **we** would have paid the preferred supplier. If no equivalent replacement is available then **we** will pay the full replacement cost of the item with no discount applied.
- **We** will not pay more than the sum insured for a claim. The amount **we** pay will also depend on any limit shown in the **policy**. **Your** cover limits will not be reduced by any claim.
- Where an **excess** applies, this will be taken off the amount of **your** claim.
- **We** will not pay for loss of value to any item or **buildings** resulting from repair or replacement following a claim.

**We** may appoint an approved supplier to act on **our** behalf to validate **your** claim. They are authorised to arrange a quotation, a repair or a replacement.

### **Contents and Business equipment**

- **We** will settle claims for loss or damage to items which are beyond economic repair on the basis of cost as new as long as:
	- the **contents** and **business equipment** have been maintained in good repair
- **We** will take off an amount for wear and tear in any claim for:
	- clothing, towels, bed or table linen.

### **Buildings**

- **We** will settle claims for loss or damage to the **buildings** without taking off an amount for wear and tear as long as:
	- the **buildings** have been maintained in good repair.
- **We** will pay for the reasonable cost of work carried out in repairing or replacing the damaged part of the **buildings** and agreed fees and related costs.
- If the repair or replacement is not carried out, **we** will pay the decrease in market value of **your buildings** due to the damage but not more than it would have cost **us** to repair the damage to **your buildings** if the repair had been carried out without delay.
- At **our** option **we** may arrange for specialist investigations to be carried out.

### **Storm Damage claims**

The definition of what **we** mean by **storm** can be found in the 'Definitions' section. When **we** assess **your**  claim, **we** will not rely solely on the definition of **storm** as this is just one factor **we** consider when **you** have this kind of damage to **your home**.

Other factors **we** consider are as follows:

- Does the evidence show that **storm** conditions occurred on or around the date the damage is said to have happened.
- Is the damage claimed for consistent with the damage caused by **storm** damage.
- Were **storm** conditions the main cause of the damage or were other factors involved. For example, **we**  look if the damage would have occurred without the **storm**. This insurance **policy** is not designed to cover **you** for any gradual deterioration, wear and tear or loss or damage resulting from poor maintenance. Please see the general exclusions and conditions section of this **policy** for more information.

**We** will always talk to **you** about what damage **you** have as well as look at the weather conditions in the area. Where **we** obtain local weather reports, **we** will take into account the distance of any weather stations from **your home** before making a decision.

In order to help assess **your** claim, **we** will also send a claims expert to **your home** to inspect the damage if necessary.

### **Matching sets, suites and carpets**

**We** treat any individual items of a matching set or suite of furniture, sanitary ware or other bathroom fittings as a single item. **We** will pay **you** for individual damaged items but not for undamaged companion pieces unless they are part of a bathroom suite or fitted kitchen and the damaged parts cannot be repaired or a replacement found.

For any other sets or suites not part of a bathroom suite or fitted kitchen, **we** will pay up to 50% of the undamaged part if the damaged parts cannot be matched or replaced.

If a floor covering is damaged beyond repair **we** will only pay to have the damaged floor covering replaced. **We** will not pay for undamaged floor covering in adjoining rooms.

### **Making a Complaint**

**We** aim to provide the highest standard of service to every customer.

If **our** service does not meet **your** expectations, **we** want to hear about it so **we** can try to put things right.

All complaints **we** receive are taken seriously. The following will help **us** understand **your** concerns and give **you** a fair response.

# **Sharing of Information**

### **Fraud prevention & Credit Reference Agencies**

We make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with information, including information from the Electoral Register. The agencies may record details of the search whether or not your application proceeds.

We may use scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity. Searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by us if you, or other members of your household, apply for other facilities including insurance applications and claims. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account.

To keep premiums low we do participate in a number of industry initiatives to prevent and detect fraud. To help prevent crime we may at any time:

- Share information about you and any others living at your property with other organisations and public bodies including the police;
- Share information about you and any others living at your property within the AXA Group and with other insurers;
- Pass the details you have supplied to recognised centralised insurance industry applications, policy and claims checking systems (for example CUE and CIFAS databases) where those details may be checked and updated;
- Check the details you have supplied with fraud prevention agencies and databases including publicly available data (for example on County Court Judgements, bankruptcy information and electoral role data). If we suspect that you have given us false or inaccurate information, we may record this with fraud prevention agencies;
- Search records held by fraud prevention and credit reference agencies to:
	- o help make decisions about credit services for you and your financial associates;
	- o help make decisions on insurance policies and claims for you and your financial associates;
	- o trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your insurance policies;
	- o check your identity to prevent money laundering.

We and other organisations may access and use, from other countries, the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.

Should you require further information about the agencies with which we share your data, including further details explaining how the information held by fraud prevention agencies may be used, please contact us at [informationsharing@axainsurance.com.](mailto:informationsharing@axainsurance.com)

#### **4. Disputes**

Subject to **Your** right to refer a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (see 'How to Make a Claim'), any dispute between **You** and **Us** may, where we both agree, be referred to an arbitrator who will be either a solicitor or a barrister.
